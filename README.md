## Description

Questions are imported using the [Open Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) in the JSON format
## Functionality
The user answers to a series of 6 multiple-choice questions, randomly generated from the API. One correct answer grants 10 points and an incorrect answer grants 0 points. Once all questions are answered ,the user can then **locally** (in the browser's Local Storage) register their score with a username, play again or return to the home page.

For training purposes, Local Storage was used instead of a database.
